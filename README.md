## Overview
This is the Voting System Project, involving the creation of an election winner calculator that focuses on two types of voting: OPL (Open Party List) and CPL (Closed Party List), as part of a project for the 'Software Engineering I' course at UMN-Twin Cities. Voting System can accept prompts for a filename (containing ballot information), reads the input file, exports the output file (containing information about winners, party, etc.), exporting an audit file, displaying winners, flip a coin when results are tied, and share the election's final results. This program assumes that the input files contain no errors, although there is error checking implemented to ensure that the file being received is in CSV format.

## Build Process
(1) Writing the Software Requirements Specification (SRS): following a **requirements elicitation** session with our client (the professor for the class), we drafted the SRS detailing our functional and non-functional requirements for the Voting System.

(2) Preparing the Software Design Document (SDD): we created **UML class diagrams, sequence and activity diagrams, as well as breakdowns of file structures for organizing various project components such as the input processing, generating an output file, displaying election results, and catering the solution to both OPL and CPL voting types. 

(3) Organizing sprints: through several sprints, we tackled several Product Backlog Items (PBIs) section by section. Constant communication and updates during our weekly standup meetings were important to guide us towards building the system by dividing responsibilities and handling blockers together. In the development stage, slight modifications to our initially planned class structure and system design were necessary. As we wrote code, we parallely worked on **testing**, both unit and integration tests.

(4) Project completion: the final stretch involved wrapping up our development and testing iterations, and submitting the project.
